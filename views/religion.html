  <h1>Raunchy Religion</h1>
  The temporary theological institution of religion appears necessary, despite its raunchy nature. Postmodernity has thoroughly decimated the supremacy of modern, western religious structures. With religion being found wanting at best and antithetical to authentic personal spirituality at worst, masses of the postmodern context although having become in some sense increasingly secular (i.e. assuming no authoritative deistic explanation of reality) are at lest somehow revived in various unstructured spiritual interests. These interests are excessively humanistic, pluralistic and personal to even be considered high-religious (i.e. presupposing a supreme deity) in the first place, and thus donâ€™t fit the mold of traditional religious structures.
<br>
  Thus, the tension reaches its head. The very religious structures which are at their worst antithetical to authentic spirituality are also are ideally the structures in which any ability to maintain doctrinal conformity is realized. This is especially true in the relativistic environment of the 21st century. Given several basic theological tenants that are here assumed, it is impossible to expect any worship of and belief in some idea rightly called God if formal religious structures are abandoned in the long-term. This creates no excuse for the raunchy extremity of self-aggrandizing, morally compromised human religion which arbitrarily creates and demands adherence to extraneous formalities that stifle true internalized spiritually-focused religious people. Religion is good at creating conformity, but its merely human form is poor at creating internal spiritual life. Still, the human intuition and idiolect is also prone to guide the self poorly on its own. This is because of the essentially (here assumed) depraved nature of the human soul. The soul is the residence of all spiritual substance in the individual but is deeply marred both in nature and action. It tends toward selfishness and ironically self-destruction.
  Hence, from where can we truly expect the healthy development of human spirituality?
